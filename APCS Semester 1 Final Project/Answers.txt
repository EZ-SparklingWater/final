FIRST QUESTION PROMPT ANSWER
Question Prompt Location: LOWER MIDDLE OF Main.java file

CODE FOR CREATING THE WORDBANK ARRAY
    String[] wordBank = {"water", "lumpy", "admin", "omega", ..., "artsy", "rural", "shave"};


Explanation of answer:

    From the provided list of five letter words, we know that the data type for the array is "string"

    Then, we also have our array name, wordBank , which is provided in the directions of the question prompt.

    Finally, we already have the provided list, so we can create our array by using the previously learned format:
        datatype[] name = {a, b, c};

Plugging in each of the parts mentioned above, we have our answer of:
    String[] wordBank = {"water", "lumpy", "admin", "omega", ..., "artsy", "rural", "shave"};

SECOND QUESTION PROMPT ANSWER
Question Prompt Location: BOTTOM OF Main.java file

CODE FOR THE RANDOM ANSWER GENERATOR
    return wordBank[(int)(Math.random() * (wordBank.length - 1))];


Explanation of answer:

    We want to return a word that will be the answer of the Wordle, and it's as simple as that, we begin our line with "return"

    Then, we can call on the array name, followed by brackets "[]" that contain the index of the desired item (refer to lesson document)

    Because we want to return a random word from the list, we can use a Math.random() function, multiplied by the length of our array.
        Math.random() is something you should already know how to utilize, so if you don't, then QUIT SLEEPING IN CLASS

    We can then take the length of our array with our "array name".length

    However, we have to keep in mind that the index of an array begins with an index of 0 representing the first item, so we must subtract "1" from the length we have grabbed.

With that, we have our answer of:
    return wordBank[(int)(Math.random() * (wordBank.length - 1))];
